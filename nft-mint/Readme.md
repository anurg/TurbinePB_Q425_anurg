##### Problems with P2P NFT sale

1. Trust required with other party
2. High chances of Fraud
3. Need to connect through some platform or Social Media App
4. Negotaiations required for reaching at agreeable Price
5. Manually transfer NFT after verifying received amount

##### Solution

Marketplace where users can list NFT for Sale with asking price. The NFT is locked in escrow account which transfers the NFT to buy when he sends the amount asked as Price. The entire process is trustless where both parties can be sure of the outcome of the deal.
